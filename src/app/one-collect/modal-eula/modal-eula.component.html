        <p class="point">
          <b>2. SCOPE.</b> This end user license agreement (“EULA”) is between
          you (“You” or “Your”), and NetApp, Inc. and (as applicable) its
          subsidiaries and affiliates (“NetApp”). This EULA sets forth the terms
          under which NetApp licenses Software and Documentation to You. In the
          absence of a more specific written agreement, this EULA applies to
          Software and Documentation obtained by You directly from NetApp,
          indirectly from a NetApp Partner or a NetApp Cloud Provider or made
          available to you by NetApp at no charge. The types, quantities and
          other usage attributes related to Your Software licenses are specified
          in other documents associated with the Software, including (as
          applicable) the Documentation, a NetApp quote or related document (for
          direct transactions), or the corresponding documents from a NetApp
          Partner or NetApp Cloud Provider (for indirect transactions). This
          EULA does not entitle You to receive Software updates, upgrades,
          technical support or professional services, which must be purchased
          separately unless otherwise provided at NetApp’s discretion.
        </p>

        <p class="point">
          <b>3. ACCEPTANCE.</b> By clicking the “I ACCEPT” button when
          downloading or installing the Software, or by copying, accessing or
          using the Software or Documentation, You agree that this EULA
          exclusively governs NetApp’s license to You and Your use of the
          Software and Documentation unless You have a separate applicable
          written agreement with NetApp. If You are accepting this EULA on
          behalf of another person, company or other legal entity, whether as an
          employee, contractor, distributor, reseller, partner, agent or
          otherwise, You represent and warrant that You have full authority to
          bind them. If You do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not
          download, install, copy, access, or use the Software or Documentation,
          or click the “I ACCEPT” button, and promptly return the Software and
          Documentation to the party from whom it was obtained.
        </p>

        <p class="point">
          <b>4. LICENSE GRANT.</b> NetApp grants to You a personal,
          nonexclusive, non-transferrable, worldwide, limited and revocable
          license, without the right to sublicense, to i) install and use the
          Software for Your internal business purposes, and ii) use the
          Documentation in support of Your use of the Software. Your Software
          license is either bundled with a specific storage controller
          identified by a unique serial number (“Controller-based”) or is
          independent of a storage controller (“Standalone”), and is one of the
          following license types:
        </p>

        <p class="sub-point">
          a) “Life-of-controller”: Controller-based licenses granted for the
          period during which Your storage controller is operable;
        </p>
        <p class="sub-point">
          b) “Perpetual”: Standalone licenses granted in perpetuity;
        </p>
        <p class="sub-point">
          c) “Term”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses granted
          for a fixed period;
        </p>
        <p class="sub-point">
          d) “Capacity”: Controller-based licenses or Standalone licenses
          granted for a specified amount of raw storage capacity, number of
          hosts, or other measure of usage as specified in the Documentation.
        </p>

        <p class="point">
          Each storage controller deployed in a cluster or a high-availability
          pair or group must have the same Controller-based license as the other
          storage controllers in that cluster, high-availability pair or group.
          Subject to NetApp’s separate written agreement, and in the context of
          non-disruptive operations within a cluster, You may deploy storage
          controllers with different Controller-based licenses and failover from
          one storage controller to another for the time required to remedy a
          failure, provided that all storage controllers in the cluster have the
          same hardware and software support offerings in effect at all times.
          Certain license types may require the enablement and use of NetApp’s
          remote support diagnostics systems.

        </p>
        <p class="sub-point">
          b) reverse-engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software or
          otherwise reduce it to human-readable format except to the extent

        <p class="point">
          <b>7. WARRANTY.</b> NetApp warrants that for a period of 90 days from
          the date of first delivery of the Software to You or a NetApp Partner,
          whichever is the earlier, or such other minimum periods under
          applicable laws (the “Software Warranty Period”), the Software will
          materially conform to the then-current Documentation. NetApp does not
          warrant that Your use of the Software will be error-free or
          uninterrupted. If a material defect arises in the Software during the
          Software Warranty Period and if the defect is reproducible and
          verifiable, NetApp will, at its sole discretion and expense, repair or
          replace the defective Software or refund the amounts received by
          NetApp for the Software. Software that is obtained for use solely in
          conjunction with a NetApp Cloud Provider’s services is provided “AS
          IS” and without a warranty of any kind. You assume all risks arising
          from Your use of the Software together with a NetApp Cloud Provider’s
          offering. The Software warranty will be voided if You or any third
          parties misuse, neglect, attempt to repair or modify (unless
          authorized by NetApp), or use the Software beyond the range of the
          intended use. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, THIS IS YOUR
          SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE WARRANTY AND REMEDY. NETAPP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS
          ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCEPTABLE
          QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE
          WARRANTY IN THIS SECTION 7 WILL NOT APPLY IF NETAPP MAKES THE SOFTWARE
          GENERALLY AVAILABLE AT NO COST.

        <p class="point">
          <b>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b> Regardless of the basis of the
          claim (e.g. contract, tort or statute), the total liability of NetApp
          and its licensors, under or in connection with this EULA, will not
          exceed the amounts actually received by NetApp for the Software or the
          minimum amounts permitted by applicable laws, if greater. NetApp and
          its licensors are not liable for:
        </p>

        <p class="sub-point">

        <p class="point">
          The limitations and exclusions above will not apply to liability for
          death or bodily injury caused by negligence, gross negligence, willful

          annually to verify compliance with this EULA. If the audit discloses
          over-usage or any other material non-compliance, then a) You will
          promptly pay to NetApp or to a NetApp Partner, as designated by
          NetApp, any additional fees that NetApp or a NetApp Partner notifies
          You are owed, and the reasonable costs of conducting the audit; and b)
          NetApp may conduct subsequent audits, upon reasonable notice, as

          relation to the Software and Documentation when due, whether payable
          to NetApp or a NetApp Partner, constitutes a material breach of this
          EULA. Upon expiration or termination of this EULA, You will promptly
          return or destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation,
          including any license enablement keys. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8,

          of a conflict between the English and non-English version of the EULA
